## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the **University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)**, advised by **Prof. Hao Chen**. My research focuses on AI-for-Science and computational biology, with an emphasis on modeling biological structures and understanding cellular aging processes.

Before joining UIC, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at **Virginia Tech**, where I worked with **Prof. Alexey Onufriev** on **cell aging prediction using Hi-C contact maps**. Our work utilized entropy-based and structure-aware metrics to characterize chromatin organization and infer cellular senescence.

I also collaborated with **Prof. Feng Wu** on **CT image enhancement and denoising**, aiming to develop lightweight, deployable medical imaging models suitable for portable or resource-constrained environments.

My long-term goal is to develop AI systems that accelerate scientific discovery, particularly in understanding biological aging and analyzing complex cellular structures.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **AI, computational biology, and medical imaging**.  
Specifically, I am interested in:

- AI-driven modeling of **chromatin structure**, cellular dynamics, and biological aging  
- Entropy-based & geometry-inspired methods for **Hi-C data analysis**  
- Data-centric and scalable ML for **cell segmentation** and structural understanding  
- Medical image enhancement and **robust denoising** for real-world deployment  
- Lightweight AI models for **portable medical diagnostic systems**

My long-term goal is to develop **AI systems that accelerate scientific discovery**, particularly in understanding biological aging and enabling reliable analysis of cellular structures.
