## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the **University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)**, advised by **Prof. Hao Chen**. My current research focuses on AI-for-Science and computational biology, with an emphasis on developing scalable and robust methods for **cell segmentation and structural analysis**.

Before joining UIC, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at **Virginia Tech**, where I worked with **Prof. Alexey Onufriev** on **cell aging prediction using Hi-C contact maps**. Our work leveraged entropy-based and structure-aware metrics to characterize chromatin organization and infer cellular senescence.

I also collaborated with **Prof. Feng Wu** on **CT image enhancement and denoising**, aiming to design lightweight, deployable medical imaging models suitable for portable or resource-constrained environments.

My long-term goal is to build AI systems that accelerate scientific discovery, particularly in understanding cellular structures, aging mechanisms, and complex biological processes.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **AI, computational biology, and medical imaging**.  
Specifically, I am interested in:

- Scalable and robust ML methods for **cell segmentation** and cellular structure analysis  
- AI-driven modeling of **chromatin organization**, cellular dynamics, and biological aging  
- Entropy-based & geometry-inspired approaches for **Hi-C data analysis**  
- Data-centric ML pipelines for large-scale biological datasets  
- Medical image enhancement and **robust denoising** for real-world deployment  
- Lightweight AI models for **portable scientific and medical diagnostic systems**

My overarching goal is to develop **AI tools that advance biological discovery**, enabling reliable and interpretable analysis of cellular and molecular structures.
